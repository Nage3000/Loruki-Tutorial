 Traversy Media Walkthrough of a multi-page website using only HTML and CSS.
 
 Brad Traversy on YouTube did a great job in helping solidify standard HTML and CSS practices in this tutorial. 
 
 I learned a lot about how to structure a website from the ground up. He provided ideas and thoughts about formatting, and how to build your own framework using a separate utilities css file.
